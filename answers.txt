What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Answer: Merge is basically adding all the changes together from one branch to another while maintaining the commit logs for both branches. 
The Rebase command lets developers integrate changes from one branch to another and rewrite the commit logs in the target branch after rebasing.

What is a remote repository?
Answer: It is a repository where if several people contribute to a project they can make changes to the project and see what each other commits. The code changes for everyone if someone changes it, commits it, and pushes it. It is a great way to collaborate on a project.
